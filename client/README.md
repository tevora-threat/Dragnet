# Dragnet

> This is an alpha and there will be breaking changes.

You will need a Firebase (Google) account to use Dragnet.
Be sure to add your project configs in the ../configs directory.

*If you don't set up security rules correctly on Firebase, the only one getting hacked will be you.*

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8085
npm run dev

# building Dragnet for production is not advised at this time.
```
